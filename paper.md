# Summary
The FRED Timeseries Analysis Package offers functions that streamline exploratory time series modeling by automating stationarity testing, grid searching for optimal ARIMA and SARIMA models, and easily fitting pre-built ARIMA and SARIMA forecasting models. The package includes model stability checks, automatic model selection, and Jupyter-optimized outputs to make it exceptionally efficient for exploratory analysis in macroeconomic research.

# Statement of need

Time series analysis is a key tool in macroeconomic modeling. Key macroeconomic indicators use time series analysis for forecasting and policy decisions. FRED provides publicly available data, current packages such as stats models contain time series functions, and packages such as fredapi allow users to download and interact with data from FRED easily. Given the emphasis on time series modeling for macroeconomics, a package that conveniently combines this functionality and automates it can save researchers time and embed reproducibility using these standard functions.
