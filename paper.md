# Summary

Economic and financial time series data are critical for forecasting, research, and policy analysis, yet accessing and preparing these datasets often remains cumbersome. The **FRED Timeseries Analysis Package** provides a lightweight, Python-based solution that automates the retrieval, processing, and modeling of economic time series directly from the Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED). By integrating standard econometric techniques within a simple, reusable framework, this package lowers the barrier to entry for time series forecasting and supports reproducible, transparent research workflows.

The package allows users to seamlessly fetch public data, resample frequencies, stabilize series via log transformations and differencing, assess stationarity through Augmented Dickey-Fuller testing, and fit ARIMA and SARIMA models for forecasting purposes. It also includes functionality for automatic model selection based on information criteria, ensuring that users can identify appropriate models without extensive manual testing. Forecasting functions automatically visualize outputs, aiding exploratory analysis. Each stage of analysis, from data acquisition through model evaluation, is handled within a consistent and minimal interface, prioritizing ease of use without sacrificing statistical rigor.

# Statement of Need

While libraries such as `pandas`, `statsmodels`, and `fredapi` offer building blocks for time series analysis, there remains a gap between accessing raw economic data and establishing a full forecasting workflow. Researchers are often required to manually manage frequency transformations, missing data imputation, and model stability checks, tasks that introduce inefficiencies and increase the risk of inconsistency across projects. The **FRED Timeseries Analysis Package** addresses this need by offering a unified set of tools that combine these steps into a coherent pipeline. The package provides standardized defaults for missing value handling, resampling, trend adjustment, and model evaluation, while remaining flexible enough to accommodate custom research designs. It also places emphasis on model stability, automatically rejecting ARIMA and SARIMA fits that exhibit signs of instability, such as unit roots or singular covariance structures. As a result, it provides a reliable, reproducible foundation for time series modeling, particularly suited to economic research, financial forecasting, and educational settings.

# Implementation and Features

The package is implemented entirely in Python and relies on widely adopted libraries including `fredapi` for data retrieval, `pandas` for data manipulation, `statsmodels` for model estimation, and `matplotlib` for visualization. It provides modular functions for each key component of the time series workflow: fetching series from FRED, adjusting frequencies, applying log-differencing for variance stabilization, conducting stationarity tests, fitting ARIMA and SARIMA models, and evaluating model fit using standard metrics such as AIC and BIC. Automatic model selection procedures search across user-specified ranges and prioritize models based on information criteria while actively avoiding unstable parameterizations. Each function is designed for compatibility with Jupyter notebooks, allowing users to quickly visualize results and iterate on analyses. The package is lightweight, easy to install, and includes example notebooks to demonstrate its capabilities and support reproducible research.

# Acknowledgements

This package builds on the foundational work of the open-source community, particularly the maintainers and contributors to `fredapi`, `pandas`, `statsmodels`, and `matplotlib`. Their tools form the technical backbone that makes this streamlined workflow possible. Special thanks are also extended to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for providing open access to economic data through the FRED API.
